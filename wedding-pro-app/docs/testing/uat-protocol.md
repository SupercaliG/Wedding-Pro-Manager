# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Protocol

This document outlines the user acceptance testing protocol for the encrypted messaging system in the Wedding Pro application. It provides structured test scenarios and checklists for manual testing by users and stakeholders.

## UAT Test Scenarios

### 1. Direct Messaging

#### Setup and Initialization
- Create a new conversation with another user
- Verify initial encryption setup
- Verify conversation history loads correctly
- Verify safety number display and verification option

#### Basic Messaging
- Send and receive text messages
- Verify message delivery status
- Verify read receipts
- Test typing indicators
- Verify message timestamps

#### Security Features
- Verify safety number display
- Complete safety number verification process
- Verify encryption indicators
- Test key backup and restore functionality

#### Edge Cases
- Test very long messages
- Test messages with special characters and emojis
- Test high message volume in a conversation
- Test with poor network connectivity

### 2. Group Chat

#### Group Creation and Management
- Create a new group chat
- Add participants to the group
- Verify all participants are displayed
- Modify group settings (name, description)
- Remove participants from the group

#### Group Messaging
- Send messages to the group
- Verify all participants receive messages
- Verify message delivery status for group messages
- Test typing indicators in group context

#### Security Features
- Verify group encryption setup
- Test adding new participants (key distribution)
- Test removing participants (key rotation)
- Verify encryption indicators for group messages

#### Edge Cases
- Test with large groups (10+ participants)
- Test with participants on different devices/platforms
- Test with participants having varying network conditions
- Test group chat after participant rejoins

### 3. Security Features

#### Key Management
- Verify safety number changes when a user reinstalls the app
- Verify inability to read messages on a new device without key backup
- Test key backup and restore functionality
- Verify end-to-end encryption by examining network traffic (if possible)

#### Access Controls
- Verify users cannot access conversations they are not part of
- Verify removed group members cannot access new messages
- Test conversation access after account logout
- Verify message persistence policies

### 4. Edge Cases

#### Message Types and Content
- Test very long messages
- Test messages with special characters and emojis
- Test messages with links
- Test messages with code snippets

#### Volume and Performance
- Test high message volume in a conversation
- Test with many simultaneous conversations
- Test with many participants in a group
- Test performance on low-end devices

#### Network Conditions
- Test messaging with intermittent connectivity
- Test message queuing when offline
- Test synchronization after reconnection
- Test with high latency connections

## UAT Test Procedure

### Preparation
1. Create test accounts for all testers
2. Provide access to the testing environment
3. Distribute UAT checklists and scenarios
4. Schedule a kickoff meeting to explain the testing process

### Execution
1. Testers work through the provided checklists
2. Document any issues or observations
3. Capture screenshots of issues when possible
4. Rate severity of any issues found (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### Reporting
1. Compile all test results and issues
2. Categorize issues by feature area and severity
3. Prioritize issues for resolution
4. Schedule review meeting to discuss findings

### Acceptance Criteria
- All critical and high severity issues must be resolved
- 90% of medium severity issues must be resolved
- Low severity issues may be deferred to future releases
- All core messaging functionality must work correctly
- Security features must pass all tests
