# Encrypted Messaging Testing Strategy

This directory contains the comprehensive testing strategy for the encrypted messaging system implemented in the Wedding Pro application. The strategy is divided into multiple documents for better organization and readability.

## Table of Contents

1. [Encryption Tests](./encryption-tests.md) - Unit tests for core encryption services
2. [Realtime Tests](./realtime-tests.md) - Integration tests for real-time message delivery and handling
3. [UI Component Tests](./ui-component-tests.md) - Unit and integration tests for React components
4. [Security Tests](./security-tests.md) - Security audits and penetration testing methodologies
5. [Cross-Functional Tests](./cross-functional-tests.md) - Testing across different network conditions and devices
6. [UAT Protocol](./uat-protocol.md) - User acceptance testing scenarios and checklists
7. [Testing Tools](./testing-tools.md) - Tools and frameworks for implementing the testing strategy

## Overview

The encrypted messaging system in Wedding Pro uses Virgil Security E3Kit for end-to-end encryption and Supabase Realtime for message delivery. This testing strategy ensures the quality, security, and reliability of the system through a combination of automated testing, security validation, cross-functional testing, and user acceptance testing.

### Key Components to Test

- **Encryption Service**: End-to-end encryption for one-to-one and group messaging
- **Realtime Service**: Real-time message delivery and event handling
- **UI Components**: User interface for direct messaging and group chats
- **Security Features**: Key management, access controls, and cryptographic implementation

### Testing Approach

The testing strategy balances automated testing (unit, integration, and E2E) with manual security audits and user acceptance testing to cover all aspects of the system. Regular execution of these tests throughout the development lifecycle will help identify and address issues early, ensuring a robust final product.
