// This file has been refactored.
// Tests for announcement actions are now in separate files:
// - create-announcement.test.ts
// - update-announcement.test.ts
// - delete-announcement.test.ts
// - get-organization-announcements.test.ts
// - track-announcement-engagement.test.ts
// - has-user-seen-announcement.test.ts

// vi.mock('@/utils/supabase/server', () => ({ createClient: vi.fn() }));
// vi.mock('next/cache', () => ({ revalidatePath: vi.fn() }));

// describe('Announcement Actions Global Setup (If Any)', () => {
  // If there were any truly global setups or tests not specific to an action,
  // they would remain here. For now, all content has been migrated.
// });
